# Spatial-resolution-of-the-MicroMegas-of-the-New-Small-Wheel-of-the-Muon-Spectrometer-of-ATLAS

This thesis aims to estimate the spatial resolution of the MicroMegas detectors of the New Small Wheels (NSWs) of the end-caps of the Muon Spectrometer of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The NSWs are vital components of the ATLAS detector upgrade for the High-Luminosity LHC period. Previous studies have shown that MicroMegas gas detectors provide excellent spatial resolution allowing accurate reconstruction and identification of the particles recorded on them. In this thesis, studies are carried out to estimate the spatial resolution of MicroMegas detectors as a function of the polar angle $\theta$ , the angle $\phi$ , the pseudo-rapidity $\eta$ and with respect to different parts of the NSWs, using simulated data with realistic parameters regarding the placement and operation of detectors. Two methodologies were used to estimate the resolution and three ways of fitting the distribution of the residuals.
